Amazon Trade is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods)
all over the world.

The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are
processed and shipped on a monthly basis. He would like a dashboard of this where he selects
a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be
shipped.

Amazon Trade has a database on Azure as well as Maria DB. The Shipping manager has
given us the details to connect to it.
